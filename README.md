# Phonetic-Converter
As an IT support agent, sometimes it is required to use NATO Phonetic Alphabets while on a call. 
Especially when describing names, passwords, recovery keys etc.
This simple application takes a set of strings, simply enter the word/phrase you'd like to convert!

Please feel free to contact me if you have any suggestions for further improvement!
