# Nato Phonetic Alphabet Converter
As an IT support agent, sometimes it is required to use NATO Phonetic Alphabets while on a call. 
Especially when describing names, passwords, recovery keys etc.

This simple application takes a set of word/phrase and converts it to Nato Alphabet. 

EX: "Covid" will output: Charlie, Oscar, Victor, India, Delta

Please feel free to contact me if you have any suggestions for further improvement!
